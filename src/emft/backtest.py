"""Expanding-window, annually refitted out-of-sample backtest.

For each test year Y, models are trained on rows whose TARGET month falls before
January of Y (so every training label was already realised) and evaluated on rows
whose target month falls in Y.

Training scopes, all evaluated on the same test region:
  own       train on the test region only (EM -> EM)
  dm_only   train on developed markets only, test on EM (the transfer test)
  pooled    train on DM and EM together
